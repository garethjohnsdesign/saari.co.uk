details:
- title: Brief
  text: Tasked to define and deliver a global digital strategy for the company in
    the context of Mission’s existing digital marketing framework, teams and international
    offering. Having regard to the client’s workforce, specialities and skills, our
    work was aimed at defining the requirements for a new integrated organisation
    and making core transformations in the company’s marketing strategy and operations
    to build an end-to-end vision. Alongside transformation marketing consultancy,
    Saari advised on the creation and development of new digital revenue streams,
    the remodelling of marketing teams and the implementation of new business growth
    models.
- title: Approach
  text: Analysing the global agency, its synergies, specific partners and the company’s
    use of digital technologies, we surveyed, interviewed and collaborated with the
    international organisation to influence, upskill and restructure its digital marketing
    offering and develop an integrated digital strategy in alignment with the company’s
    global plan. Harnessing the company’s digital marketing and strategic operations
    to transform business effectiveness and drive higher sales and productivity. Defining
    relevant product offering including freelance workforce looking at creativity
    in parallel with technological change and opportunity.
- title: Outcome
  text: A focused, integrated organisation with a deeper understanding of digital
    technologies across the wider communications and creative agency on a global scale.
    Design and integration of new agency disciplines and concentration on new areas
    of business development and growth models. Creation and maintenance of a robust
    and effective operating model with the appropriate systems and teams as part of
    new business development.  Generation of direct digital business growth just short
    of 200% year on year with new digital product value (insights, consultancy & new
    partnerships) worth 70k in the first 9 months of operation.
testimonial:
  text: I hired Nikke to lead our digital strategy and direction for Mission Media.
    His job was to develop our approach as a truly integrated creative communications
    agency alongside new product development in digital marketing and insights.  Nikke
    collaborated with all Mission teams working with everyone in order to develop
    the company's overall strategy. He excelled in new business for the likes of Unilever
    and Amazon alongside delivering successful campaigns for some of our biggest clients
    and brands, including Allergan and Peroni. I would highly recommend Nikke for
    his leadership skills and future-forward approach as well as for his progressive,
    strategic thought processes as an effective marketeer for the communications business.
