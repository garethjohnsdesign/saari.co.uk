- title: Brief
  text: 'Saari were engaged by an award-winning leader in private air charter, Fly
    Victor, to develop an attribution strategy for social media advertising assigning
    value to the channels driving an outcome with the aim of improving sales tracking
    and examining the digital media spend against trends. Part of Saari''s brief was
    to also drive messaging in the context of initiating and engaging in a global
    conversation on climate change to offset carbon emissions. This was particularly
    relevant as Fly Victor was launching an industry-first climate action campaign
    to lead the aviation sector to a more sustainable future and a CEO initiative
    #BeyondOffset, which called for businesses to identify and invest in climate action
    solutions.'
- title: Approach
  text: Saari carried out an extensive search audit to understand current performance,
    competitors and provide recommendations on how Fly Victor could maximise their
    ROI. A new paid search strategy was developed with a budget and determined KPIs
    were put in place.
- title: Outcome
  text: The new paid digital advertising strategy delivered significant results for
    Fly Victor within a very short time. A new campaign structure together with carefully
    tailored ad copy were introduced, which substantially exceeded the initial KPIs
    set.  Saari increased lead interest rates with a noticeable improvement in the
    quality of social leads making it an extremely successful campaign.
