- title: Brief
  text: "Saari were engaged to develop an online community and produce a multi-platform
    content strategy to support a community campaign for the river houseboat community
    in Chelsea to preserve the character of this important part of Chelsea riverside.
    \ The houseboat community at Chelsea Reach has been in place since the 1930s and
    some of the current residents have lived there for over 50 years.  \n"
- title: Approach
  text: 'Working closely with the houseboat Committee, Saari was able to plan and
    design an effective digital strategy to build an online community to support the
    actual houseboat community to enable the community to gain support and reach a
    wider audience. The content management strategy was developed so as to increase
    awareness of the community and drive engagement working with partners and the
    wider community. '
- title: Outcome
  text: 'By driving consistent planned and tailored content and maintaining communication,
    the online community platform was brought to life.  Awareness of the community
    grew substantially through a strong engagement base together with the communityâ€™s
    exposure through their social media channels. This enabled strong community ties
    to be formed and maintained to drive awareness of this important part of Chelsea
    community life. #communitynotcommodity
