  text: "FISKOLíA defines a healthy mindset and a positive attitude towards life.
    FISKOLíA is deep-rooted in Icelandic culture, has a strong sense of origin and
    pristine nature forms and stark landscapes are at the heart of this brand.   \n\nSaari
    were chosen to strategically plan and execute across content marketing, influencer
    marketing, digital advertising, strategy consulting and branding. This was for
    the purpose of increasing and driving brand awareness, engagement and conversion
    to sales. Saari were also asked to advise on the curation of FISKOLíA’s international
    online presence. \n\nFISKOLíA wished to improve their overall digital visibility
    especially within the UK whilst educating their customers about their products
    being sustainably sourced and the array of potential health benefits which can
    occur on consumption."

    marketing vision with locally relevant tactics and the development of a clear
    visual brand. Brand alignment and outreach to the customer target groups in multiple
    markets was a key goal.
