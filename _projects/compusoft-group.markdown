- title: Brief
  text: "Compusoft Group are one of the fastest-growing global kitchen and bathroom
    design software providers thanks to their preeminent software solutions and exceptional
    expertise connecting design and production. Due to their specialist integrated
    software taking customers from the design stage through to installation and their
    invaluable customer support, Compusoft Group have become a global design authority
    across 14 different markets, including Europe, Australasia and South Africa. \n\nAs
    part of their rebranding, Compusoft Group reached out to Saari to create a website
    offering for them to allow them to transition to a modern and agile infrastructure
    with a view to reflecting their status as a specialist authority on software solutions.
    The aim was to create a website which would provide international marketing teams
    with an easy to use and customisable tool which seamlessly integrates with Salesforce.
    The outdated and rigid .net framework did not support the corporate vision required
    by Compusoft Group in order to take them to the next week. \n"
- title: Approach
  text: "With a solid focus on the user and on business value, Saari was able to create
    an agile and streamlined product for Compusoft Group with progressive technological
    foundations to allow them to stay ahead. \n\nWith a deep understanding of the
    international challenges involved, Saari applied an integrated, flexible approach
    in order to project manage and deliver a sleek yet cost-effective solution. \n"
- title: Outcome
  text: Saari crafted a modern website solution putting users at the heart of the
    experience to provide an easily navigable product with a solid emphasis on data
    accuracy and support. Functionalities were developed to provide both end-users
    and marketing teams with a sleek and streamlined experience across all devices
    and browsers guiding them from the design stage through to production. The new
    website provides sales and marketing with a tool to allow Compusoft Group to scale
    in line with their growth strategy.
